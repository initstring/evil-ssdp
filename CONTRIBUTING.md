# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you so much for thinking about contributing!

There are a few ways you can help, if you're so inclined:

- Open up an issue on here if you notice something odd.
- Submit a feature request if you think the tool should be doing something additional.
- Submit bug fixes or streamlime the existing code.

I'd like to keep the tool pretty straightforward, so that it does one thing and does it well.

Before you spend a lot of time re-writing something massive, it might be worth contacting me first just to make sure I'm not in the middle of a conflicting re-write. You can open an issue or try me at protonmail.

I may redirect commits to the dev branch for some burning in before pushing to master. If there is any type of credit of special handling you'd like with your contribution, please let me know and I will do my best to oblige.

Some info on contributing code:
    - Python 3, without maintaining backwards support for Python 2
    - Run through pylint for best-effort PEP8

Thanks for reading!
